# InterviewTask_Appodeal
1. For somehow I haven't faced with issue "Some *Dependencies.xml files wonâ€™t be installed", so I haven't do anything to do this behaviour.
3. I added alternative method AppodealValidateInAppPurchase and keeped previous version to keep compability. Also I dont have mac device to build iOS.
6. Also I dont have Xcode on my windows PC, so I copied [appodeal privacy manifest](https://docs.appodeal.com/ios/data-protection/privacy-manifest).

updated .unitypackage is in releases folder.
